### Hi there 👋

✨ Welcome to Sookie's Kitchen ✨ 

Here I am cooking up some knowledge and ideas.

- 🔭 I am new at web design and web development.
- 🌱 I am learning CSS and PHP at the moment. My plan is to learn JavaScript next.
- 👯 So far, I am still a beginner, and like to figure out little mistakes independantly.
- 🤔 I will most likely need help when I start incorporating data bases and PHP code.
- 💬 Ask me anything!
- 📫 At the moment, I have no public profile.
- 😄 Expect some contect about my interests (look into the repository for more)!
- ⚡ If you have some advice on chasing a career in Web Development, please let me know!

- ❤️ All pages here are WIP - I am just trying new things. Sometimes I think about looks of the page, but mostly I want to see how things work. Please do not judge too harshly.
